                    <br>
                    <h4>instructions:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare Ingredients: Cut the pork into bite-sized pieces, peel the hard-boiled eggs, and mince the garlic.</li>
                        <li>Sear the Pork: Heat a bit of oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown the pork pieces on all sides until they develop a golden color.</li>
                        <li>Add Aromatics: Add the minced garlic and sliced ginger to the pot. Stir and cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Braise the Pork: Pour in the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, oyster sauce, and sugar. Mix well. Add water or chicken broth to cover the pork. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                        <li>Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Allow the pork to simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed.</li>
                        <li>Add Eggs: Gently add the peeled hard-boiled eggs to the pot during the last 30-45 minutes of cooking. Allow the eggs to absorb the flavors of the braising liquid.</li>
                        <li>Finish: Once the pork is tender and the eggs are infused with flavor, check the seasoning and adjust if necessary. If desired, drizzle a bit of sesame oil for extra flavor.</li>
                        <li>Serve: Serve the braised pork with eggs over steamed rice. Garnish with chopped green onions or chili if you like.</li>

                        <li>Prepare the chicken: Rinse the chicken thoroughly with cold water to remove any impurities. You can pluck the chicken feathers by boiling water and dipping the chicken into hot water for a few minutes. </li>
                        <li>Boiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt to the boiling water (about 1-2 tablespoons), ensuring the water is evenly salted.</li>
                        <li>Boil the chicken: Once the water is boiling, place the chicken into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for about 40-60 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken. To check if the chicken is cooked, you can use a toothpick to pierce the thigh and check if the juices run clear.</li>
                        <li>STurn off the heat and soak the chicken: When the chicken is cooked, turn off the heat and leave the chicken in the hot water for about 10-15 minutes to allow the meat to absorb the flavors.</li>
                        <li>Rinse with cold water: After soaking, place the chicken in cold water or an ice bath to cool the meat and enhance its flavor.</li>
                        <li>Season to taste: Boiled chicken can be served with sweet and sour fish sauce, salt and pepper lime, or any sauce of your preference.</li>
