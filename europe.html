                        <h2 >Pháo Hoa (fireworks)</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fireworks are a significant and popular element of Tet, the Lunar New Year celebration in Vietnam. The use of fireworks during Tet is a long-standing tradition and a symbol of the festive and celebratory atmosphere that accompanies the holiday.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Fireworks are believed to ward off evil spirits and bring good luck for the coming year. The loud noises and bright colors are thought to scare away negative forces and create a joyful and auspicious beginning to the new lunar year. In major cities and towns across Vietnam, local governments often organize large-scale fireworks displays to mark the arrival of Tet. These displays are usually held in public spaces, providing a communal experience for residents and visitors.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The most significant fireworks displays typically occur at midnight on New Year's Eve, signaling the transition from the old year to the new one. This moment is accompanied by various customs and traditions and including family gatherings. Traditionally, firecrackers were a common feature of Tet celebrations. However, due to safety concerns and regulations in some urban areas, the use of firecrackers has been restricted or banned. Fireworks displays have become a safer alternative. </p>
